## How to Use
Pick a prism to select it.

Pull the knobs to create adjacent prisms.

Pick the ring between prisms to create a section.

Click on an empty area to deselect.

Change shape, prism, section and training properties using the toolbar.

Change section type between actuator and separator. Actuators used for movement during training. Separators used to disjoint contacting prisms.

Start training with viewing intermediate results or just play trained simulation.

Save and load creations including trained data which is updated at a specified interval.

Click the Showcase button to display a sample shape in random order.
